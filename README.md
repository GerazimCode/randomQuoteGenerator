# randomQuoteGenerator
This is a simple web app that displays famous random quotes each time a user clicks a button.
The project contains an array of objects that houses the quotes and its attributes.
Certains quotes have citatons and year attributes while other do not, therefore there is a condition that checks if such attributes are present and displays them on the page.
